# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of classic and essential data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. Whether you are a student preparing for coding interviews, a programmer looking to refresh your knowledge, or just an enthusiast eager to explore data structures and algorithms, this repository is the perfect resource to get started.

**Note**: While the implementations are intended to be educational and informative, they may not always be the most efficient or optimized versions for production use. The primary goal is to provide clear and concise code to aid in understanding the concepts.

## Introduction

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as an educational resource for learning data structures and algorithms. Each data structure and algorithm implementation includes explanations, time complexity analysis, and example use cases, where applicable. You are encouraged to explore the code and modify it to deepen your understanding.

## Data Structures

### 1. Array

The array is a fundamental data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. It supports constant-time access to elements using their indices.

### 2. Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists allow for efficient insertions and deletions but require linear time for access.

### 3. Stack

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It is used in various algorithms, such as parsing expressions and backtracking.

### 4. Queue

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. It is commonly used in scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms.

### 5. Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is widely used for organizing hierarchical data, searching, and dynamic memory allocation.

### 6. Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. It is a versatile data structure used in various real-world applications, such as social networks and routing algorithms.

### 7. Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides constant-time average lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Algorithms

### 1. Sorting

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. This section includes implementations of various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

### 2. Searching

Searching algorithms find the location of a specific element within a collection of elements. This section includes algorithms like Binary Search and Linear Search.

### 3. Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This section covers recursive algorithms and their applications.

### 4. Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems. This section contains dynamic programming solutions for various classic problems.

### 5. Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms deal with operations on graphs, such as finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, and traversing graphs.

### 6. Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. This section includes algorithms like the Knapsack problem and Huffman encoding.
